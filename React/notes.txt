What is React:

React is a declarative JavaScript library created by Facebook (Meta) for rendering views in applications.
At its core, it used Virtual DOM to process updates to the view. 
DOM - Document Object Model -> The way we interact with the browser to make changes to a web page. 
It endorses a component-based architecture, where an application is a tree of components.
MVC - Model View Controller -> React is not a MVC framework
React is used to build user interfaces in Single Page Applications (SPAs), mobile apps and more...

Functional Programming Concepts:

We will review some important functional programming concepts such as...

    Immutability
        Data structures that should not be mutated
    Pure Functions
    Side Effects

Pure Functions:

A pure function is a function that meets the following criteria...

    The same inputs produce the same outputs
    Had no side effects

------------------

On the side: 
Unit Testing is a concept in SE, a form of application testing typically done by SEs,  unit testing is programmaticly creating code
that tests pieces of an application. It makes sure that we don't break existing functionality.

------------------

Side Effects:

Side effects are any application state change that is observed outside of the function


------------------

Building Blocks:

Components
    Are the core building blocks in React
    Follow strict encapsulation principles - each in independent and reusable

Composition
    Components can be compsed of other components
    Oftentimes, Reach apps have a top-level 'App' component

Elements
    Components return elements
    They describle what should appear on the screen
    Virtual DOM updates the DOM to match the React elements

Props
    Components are passed inputs, called 'props'
    Props are treated as immutable

State
    Components may or may not have state
    State is local to the component only and not accessible outside

------------------

Why choose React?

Makes JavaScript more structured, easier to write
Runs faster than JavaScript with HTML + CSS + jQuery/AJAX
Well-supported development platform & ecosystem

Benefits:
    Allows front end engineers to focus on building User interfaces
    Allows for "snappier" apps and rich user interactions
    Delegate business logic to browser and mobile devices to reduce the need for heavy servers (in Single Page Applications)
    Architecture is web and mobile friendly

------------------

Characteristics of React:

Virtual DOM:

React uses a virtual DOM to compare changes between render function calls in memory and makes minimal changes to the real DOM

One Way Data Flow:

Immutable data is passed to React components to be rendered
No more two way data binding
Components cannot modify data being passed to it, but instead they can trigger actions to change component state 
Overall application data flow is done with other frameworks such as Redux

Components Lifecycle:

The basic life of a React component:

Mount
    The component has been created and added to the DOM
Render
    The component may render and re-render for a while
Demount
    The component is no longer needed

Component Rendering:

When does a component re-render? -> Any time state or props change.

Why would it be a bad idea to update state in render? -> You might get caught in an infinite loop as state updates

How to prevent unnecessary re-renderes?
    Pass only the props we need
    If props have changed, but their values are equivalent, a re-render will still occur by default
