Some notes about debugging javascript.

Types of errors:

Syntax Errors:

    Mispelling things, missing semicolons, and such. The IDE usually catches these.

Runtime Errors:

    Where code fails to execule or had unexpected behaviour
    Like an infinite loop
    IDEs do not usually catch these

Semantic (or logical) errors:

    All syntax and runtime errors are not present, this is human error
    ie. area = width + height instead of area = width * height
    The IDE may not pick up the errors.


Traditional Debugging:

We can use
    console.Time and console.TimeEnd
    console.assert will log when value is falsy value
    console.table
    console.clear
    console.dir
