Notes for REST. 

Documentation is very important. APIs are often undocumented for some reason. 

Interface - User Interface -> THe portion of an application that is exposed to the outisde world for users to interact with

API - Application Programming Interface

Think about APIs as the public entry points into a system. 

Their audiences are developers or other applications. 
APIS are generally a collection of functions or methods with known signatures and data models that 
can garner data for you. 

Different types of APIs:
    Libraries and Frameworks:
        Software Libraries

    Operation Systems:
        Specifies the interface between and application and the operating system

    Web Services:
        The interface for one application to exchange data with another over the Web


We will will be focusing on web services and web APIs. 

Message Protocol vs Transport Protocol

Message Protocol:
    Structure and format of messages
    Ex. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)

Transport Protocol:
    Exchange of messages
    Ex. HTTP, WebSocket, TCP WebSocket

What is a REST API?

REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer

It has an architectural style for sharing data between applications and is comprised of 6 architectural constraints.
Implemented over HTTP. 

REST is comprised of:
    Services
    Resources
    Representations
    Verbs

The 6 Architectural constraints of rest:

Uniform Interface:
    Define the interface between the client and the server
    Simplifies and decouples architecture
    Restful design
        HTTP verbs (e.g. GET, PUT, POST, DELETE)
    
Stateless:
    The server does not remember anything about the user using the API
    Each individual request contains all the information the server needs to perform the request
    and return a response, regardless of other requests made by the same API user
