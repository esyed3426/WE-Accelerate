Notes for REST. 

Documentation is very important. APIs are often undocumented for some reason. 

Interface - User Interface -> THe portion of an application that is exposed to the outisde world for users to interact with

API - Application Programming Interface

Think about APIs as the public entry points into a system. 

Their audiences are developers or other applications. 
APIS are generally a collection of functions or methods with known signatures and data models that 
can garner data for you. 

Different types of APIs:
    Libraries and Frameworks:
        Software Libraries

    Operation Systems:
        Specifies the interface between and application and the operating system
        
    Web Services:
        The interface for one application to exchange data with another over the Web
